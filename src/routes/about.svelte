	<p>A Kowakian monkey-lizard with a shrill cackle, Salacious Crumb sat on Jabba's dais, stealing bits of food and mimicking the Hutt, his courtiers, and visitors. The Hutt's noxious pet was the palace's unofficial court jester, tolerated because his antics amused Jabba, and because of his unwavering support for his master.</p>
